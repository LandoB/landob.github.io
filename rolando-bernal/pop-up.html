								<h4>Project Overview</h4>
								<p>"RE-Grocery-App" is an app that helps people that live under a budget. The idea came out from a friend of a friend of mine that always goes to the grocery store with her 3 kids, her gorcery list on a piece of paper, a pen, and a calculator. Always trying to calculate what she was spending so she wouldn't go over her budget. I wanted to create an app that would help to improve that situation.</p>
