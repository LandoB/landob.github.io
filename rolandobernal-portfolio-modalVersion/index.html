											<h3><i class="icon-user icon-white"></i> More About Me?</h3>
											Originally from Mexico, I moved to the US in 2008. I've lived in Nashville, TN since then and I'm proud to call it "home". I'm a husband, married to a beautiful woman from Dickson, TN. I'm also a dad, I have two beautiful children: Violet (7) and Levi (1). My family is the biggest joy I have found in my life.  
											</div>
											<div class="span3">
											<h3><i class="icon-heart icon-white"></i> What I Love</h3>
											I love golf. My best score is 84 and I hope to break 80 at some point one of these days. I love Football, big Tennessee Titans fan. I love soccer, have played it since I was a kid. I love going to the movies, either with my wife to see a fun movie, with my kids to see a Disney or any cartoon movie, or with my friends, to see the latest action/super-hero movie. Sometimes I cook. 
											</div>
											<div class="span3">
											<h3><i class="icon-fire icon-white"></i> Work Hard</h3>
											I am an avid follower of technology. I offer you a complete web solution. I can guide you through the early stages of project planning and research, help you with information architecture and user experience, design your website, and finally build the site for you.<br/> My approach? Simple and Functional. It is too easy for us to complicate our lives, why do so with our software?
											</div>   
											<div class="span3">
											<h3><i class="icon-plane icon-white"></i> Ready To Go</h3>
											I just finished a 6 month software bootcamp in Nashville. I learned Frontend and Backend Development.<br/> Frontend Development: HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, AngularJS.<br/> Backend Development: C#, .Net, SQL, SQL Server, SQLite, Postgres.<br/> Other: Grunt, Gulp, VIM, Git, GitHub, Visual Studio, Command Line, RESTful API, MVC, Bower, NPM.<br/> In my previous experiences, I have found satisfaction in discovering and implementing solutions. Now I am very excited to be doing just that through code.
